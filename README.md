   The main.sh will install the requirements, download the repo, then navigate to the src/ folder of the downloaded repo and run the launch.py script which will implement the project.

2. Or, you can clone this repo, install the requirements then navigate to src/ and run launch.py

Note: while running main.sh you will be prompted to add your labsuser.pem file to the src/ folder. Also you will need to put your aws credentials in the ~/.aws/credentials file.
