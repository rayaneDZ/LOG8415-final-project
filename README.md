# LOG8415-final-project

## Scaling Databases and Implementing Cloud Patterns

The final individual project for the course LOG8415E (Polytechnique Montr√©al)

To run this program, you can either:

1. Download the main.sh bash script and run it on your local machine.
   The main.sh script will install the requirements and download the repo.
   You will then have to cd into LoG8415-final-project/src and run launch.py (or launch3.py if you're using python3)

2. Or, you can clone this repo, install the requirements you will find in the requirements.txt file then navigate to src/ and run launch.py

Note: while running main.sh you will be prompted to add your labsuser.pem file to the src/ folder. Also you will need to put your aws credentials in the ~/.aws/credentials file.
